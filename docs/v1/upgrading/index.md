## 📌 How to Upgrade

1. **Check your current package version**  
   Open your `.csproj` file and look for the version of `OpenSettings` packages you are currently using.

2. **Find your upgrade path**  
   Based on your version, follow the appropriate step-by-step page. For example:

   - If you're using `v1.0.x`, start with the [v1.0 to v1.1](v1.0-to-v1.1.md) page.

3. **Apply migrations and changes**  
   Follow the instructions in each page carefully—some versions may require database or code-level changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're skipping multiple versions, apply each upgrade sequentially (e.g., v1.0 → v1.1 → etc).
