# 🧭 Upgrade OpenSettings v1.0 ➡ v1.1

> ⚠️ This page outlines the steps required to upgrade from version **1.0**.* to **1.1**.* of OpenSettings.

---

## 📦 Affected Packages

Ensure you update the following NuGet packages:

- `OpenSettings` → `1.1.*`
- `OpenSettings.AspNetCore` → `1.1.*`
- `OpenSettings.AspNetCore.Spa` → `1.1.*`

You can update via CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package OpenSettings --version 1.1.*
dotnet add package OpenSettings.AspNetCore --version 1.1.*
dotnet add package OpenSettings.AspNetCore.Spa --version 1.1.*
```

## 🎢 **Generate Migration**

If your application acts as a provider and persists data using the included OpenSettingsDbContext, you'll need to apply a database migration

Run the following command from your executable project directory:

```sh
dotnet ef migrations add OpenSettingsDbMigration_v1_1 -c OpenSettingsDbContext -o Data/Migrations/OpenSettings/OpenSettingsDb
```

✅ **Verify:** After executing the command, you should see:

- `..._OpenSettingsDbMigration_v1.1.cs`
- `..._OpenSettingsDbMigration_v1.1.Designer.cs`

Inside: 

```sh
Data/Migrations/OpenSettings/OpenSettingsDb/
``` 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For EF tools setup and guidance, refer to our [Migration Guide](../docs/data-storage-and-migration-guide.md#-database-migrations).    


## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Did you get an error?

If you encounter an error when running the EF command, try running the EF command with the `-v` prefix for verbose logs:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add OpenSettingsDbMigration_v1_1 -c OpenSettingsDbContext -o Data/Migrations/OpenSettings/OpenSettingsDb -v
```

Search on the web if there is already a solution out there.

### If you see the following error:

> `An error occurred while accessing the Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting services. Continuing without the application service provider. Error: An error was generated for warning 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations.PendingModelChangesWarning': The model for context 'OpenSettingsDbContext' has pending changes. Add a new migration before updating the database. See https://aka.ms/efcore-docs-pending-changes. This exception can be suppressed or logged by passing event ID 'RelationalEventId.PendingModelChangesWarning' to the 'ConfigureWarnings' method in 'DbContext.OnConfiguring' or 'AddDbContext'.` 

### Explanation:

This error means you are upgrading versions sequentially, and some versions may not have been updated properly. When upgrading, OpenSettings will automatically attempt to update the database when it runs. If you encounter this error, it’s typically because some migrations haven't been applied yet.

### Solution:

You can bypass this error by adding the following configuration to your OpenSettings setup to suppress the warning:

```csharp
openSettingsConfiguration.Provider.Orm.ConfigureDbContext = optsBuilder =>
{
    optsBuilder.ConfigureWarnings(w => w.Ignore(RelationalEventId.PendingModelChangesWarning));
};
```

This configuration will ignore the `PendingModelChangesWarning` and allow the application to run without halting on this warning.
