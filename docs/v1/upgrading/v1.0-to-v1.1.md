# 🧭 Upgrade OpenSettings v1.0 ➡ v1.1

> ⚠️ This page outlines the steps required to upgrade from version **1.0**.* to **1.1**.* of OpenSettings.

---

## 📦 Affected Packages

Ensure you update the following NuGet packages:

- `OpenSettings` → `1.1.*`
- `OpenSettings.AspNetCore` → `1.1.*`
- `OpenSettings.AspNetCore.Spa` → `1.1.*`

You can update via CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package OpenSettings --version 1.1.*
dotnet add package OpenSettings.AspNetCore --version 1.1.*
dotnet add package OpenSettings.AspNetCore.Spa --version 1.1.*
```

## 🎢 **Generate Migration**

If your application acts as a provider and persists data using the included OpenSettingsDbContext, you'll need to apply a database migration

Run the following command from your executable project directory:

```sh
dotnet ef migrations add OpenSettingsDbMigration_v1_1 -c OpenSettingsDbContext -o Data/Migrations/OpenSettings/OpenSettingsDb
```

✅ **Verify:** After executing the command, you should see:

- `..._OpenSettingsDbMigration_v1.1.cs`
- `..._OpenSettingsDbMigration_v1.1.Designer.cs`

Inside: 

```sh
Data/Migrations/OpenSettings/OpenSettingsDb/
``` 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For EF tools setup and guidance, refer to our [Migration Guide](../docs/data-storage-and-migration-guide.md#-database-migrations).
