# Version: *1.0.0-preview.1.0.3* - Date: *2025-03-17*

---

### 🚀 **Overview**
This version is the preview release and fixes the issue with pre-settings file generation and improves migration handling, serving as a foundation for the upcoming stable release of 1.0.0.

### ✨ **Added**
* Added `#if Migration` preprocessor directives to handle migration generation and avoid infinite waiting. 
* `--configuration Migration` parameter now required when generating migrations.

### 🐛 **Fixed**
* Resolved issue where pre-settings files were not being generated correctly. The logic now properly handles the creation of pre-settings files based on the correct keys (issue from the first preview release ``1.0.0-preview.1.0.0``).
* Resolved issue where migration generation was stuck waiting infinitely until the **--configuration Migration** parameter was passed (issue introduced in version `1.0.0-preview.1.0.2`).
