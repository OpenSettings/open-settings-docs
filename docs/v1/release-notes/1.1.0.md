# Version: *1.1.0* - Date: *2025-04-09*

---

### ðŸš€ **Overview**
Version 1.1.0 is now released. This update includes significant improvements to configuration management, method visibility, and migration handling. The controller and SPA configurations can now be managed through the OpenSettings Spa, and several important internal changes have been made for better flexibility and ease of use.

### âœ¨ **Added**
* Added ability to manage controller and Spa configuration directly through the OpenSettings Spa.
* The default value for the identifier name is now automatically calculated based on an environment variable, simplifying configuration.

### ðŸ”„ **Changed**
* `UseOpenSettingsSpa(...)` method is now private. Users can no longer directly call this method. The enablement and disablement of the Spa is now managed through the configuration tab in the UI, based on the `OpenSettingsConfiguration.Spa.IsActive` property. If active, `UseOpenSettings()` will internally call `UseOpenSettingsSpa()`.
* The configuration, previously set via code, is now entirely managed through the OpenSettings Spa, eliminating the need for manual configuration in the code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
