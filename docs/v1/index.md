# Getting Started

To integrate OpenSettings into your project, you'll first need to install the required libraries.

### 1️⃣ Install OpenSettings
```sh
dotnet add package OpenSettings.AspNetCore
```

### 2️⃣ Install a Storage Provider
For this guide, we'll use **InMemory storage** for simplicity. Install it with:

```sh
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
```

If you're using a different database, replace this package with the appropriate EF Core provider (e.g., `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` for SQL Server).

## 🏗 Configuring OpenSettings

OpenSettings can run in two modes: **Provider** or **Consumer**. Choose the appropriate configuration based on your application’s role. For more information check out the [Basics](basics.md)

### 🔹 Provider Configuration

```csharp
var openSettingsConfiguration = new OpenSettingsConfiguration(ServiceType.Provider)
{
    Client = new ClientInfo(
        new Guid("adbdf741-bb4d-4673-b2a8-23e677fcf454"), // The unique identifier for the client.
        new Guid("4294a5e3-0839-4358-a03d-1ac52585ae5f")  // The secret key for the client.
    ),
};
```

> [!TIP]
> Want to enable **auto-registration** of consumers?
> Set `AllowAnonymousAccess` to **true** in the configuration.

#### 🗄 Configuring Database Storage

```csharp
// Configure database storage (InMemory for this example)
openSettingsProviderConfiguration.Provider.Orm.ConfigureDbContext = optsBuilder =>
{
    optsBuilder.UseInMemoryDatabase("OpenSettings");
};
```

### 🔹 Consumer Configuration

```csharp
var openSettingsConfiguration = new OpenSettingsConfiguration(ServiceType.Consumer)
{
    Client = new ClientInfo(
        new Guid("71059bda-bb49-447f-ac83-60cd15c9518d"), // The unique identifier for the client.
        new Guid("6c52c9f7-d43c-44c1-8d6c-451bf9029731")  // The secret key for the client.
    ),
	Consumer = new ConsumerConfiguration
    {
      ProviderUrl = "http://localhost:5002/api/settings", // Url of the provider service.
    }
};
```

## 🔧 Registering OpenSettings

### 1️⃣ Enable OpenSettings In The Host Builder

```csharp
await builder.Host.UseOpenSettingsAsync(openSettingsProviderConfiguration);
```

### 2️⃣ Add OpenSettings Controllers

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddControllers()
    .AddOpenSettingsController(builder.Configuration); // Enables OpenSettings Controllers
```

### 3️⃣ Integrate OpenSettings Middleware
Ensure OpenSettings is registered in the pipeline **between** `UseRouting` and `MapControllers`.

```csharp
...
app.UseRouting();

app.UseOpenSettings(); // Updates instance status when the application starts or stops.
app.UseOpenSettingsSpa(); // Enables OpenSettings SPA for viewing & editing settings.

app.MapControllers();
...
```

## 📌 Defining Your First Setting

Define a setting by creating a new class that implements `ISettings`.

```csharp
using OpenSettings.Services.Interfaces;

public class MyFirstSetting : ISettings
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}
```

Run the application and navigate to ".../settings" to view and manage your settings.

## 🔹 Resolving Settings In The Application

You can inject and access your settings using **dependency injection**.

### 🔹 Accessing as a Singleton

Inject the setting directly into your constructor:

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly MyFirstSetting _myFirstSetting;

    public MyService(MyFirstSetting myFirstSetting)
    {
        _myFirstSetting = myFirstSetting;
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Using IOptions<T> For Configuration Binding

Alternatively, use `IOptions<T>` for accessing configuration-based settings:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;

public class MyService
{
    private readonly MyFirstSetting _myFirstSetting;

    public MyService(IOptions<MyFirstSetting> options)
    {
        _myFirstSetting = options.Value;
    }
}
```

This approach is useful when the settings are dynamically **loaded from configuration sources**.
