# Getting Started

To integrate OpenSettings into your project, you'll first need to install the required libraries.

### 1️⃣ Install OpenSettings
```sh
dotnet add package OpenSettings.AspNetCore
```

### 2️⃣ Install a Storage Provider
For this guide, we'll use **InMemory storage** for simplicity. Install it with:

```sh
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
```

If you're using a different database, replace this package with the appropriate EF Core provider (e.g., `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` for SQL Server).

## 🏗 Configuring OpenSettings

OpenSettings can run in two modes: **Provider** or **Consumer**. Choose the appropriate configuration based on your application’s role. For more information check out the [Consumer vs Provider](docs/introduction.md#consumer-vs-provider-what-do-they-mean)

### 🔹 Provider Configuration

```csharp
var openSettingsConfiguration = new OpenSettingsConfiguration(ServiceType.Provider)
{
    Client = new ClientInfo(
        new Guid("adbdf741-bb4d-4673-b2a8-23e677fcf454"), // The unique identifier for the client.
        new Guid("4294a5e3-0839-4358-a03d-1ac52585ae5f")  // The secret key for the client.
    ),
};
```

#### 🗄 Configuring Database Storage

```csharp
// Configure database storage (InMemory for this example)
openSettingsProviderConfiguration.Provider.Orm.ConfigureDbContext = optsBuilder =>
{
    optsBuilder.UseInMemoryDatabase("OpenSettings");
};
```

### 🔹 Consumer Configuration

```csharp
var openSettingsConfiguration = new OpenSettingsConfiguration(ServiceType.Consumer)
{
    Client = new ClientInfo(
        new Guid("71059bda-bb49-447f-ac83-60cd15c9518d"), // The unique identifier for the client.
        new Guid("6c52c9f7-d43c-44c1-8d6c-451bf9029731")  // The secret key for the client.
    ),
	Consumer = new ConsumerConfiguration
    {
      ProviderUrl = "http://localhost:5002/api/settings", // Url of the provider service.
    }
};
```

## 🔧 Registering OpenSettings

### 1️⃣ Enable OpenSettings In The Host Builder

```csharp
await builder.Host.UseOpenSettingsAsync(openSettingsProviderConfiguration);
```

### 2️⃣ Add OpenSettings Controllers

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddControllers()
    .AddOpenSettingsController(builder.Configuration); // Enables OpenSettings Controllers
```

### 3️⃣ Integrate OpenSettings Middleware
Ensure OpenSettings is registered in the pipeline **between** `UseRouting` and `MapControllers`.

```csharp
...
app.UseRouting();

app.UseOpenSettings(); // Updates instance status when the application starts or stops.
app.UseOpenSettingsSpa(); // Enables OpenSettings SPA for viewing & editing settings.

app.MapControllers();
...
```

## 📌 Defining Your First Setting

Define a setting by creating a new class that implements `ISettings`.

```csharp
using OpenSettings.Services.Interfaces;

public class MyFirstSettings : ISettings
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}
```

Run the application and navigate to ".../settings" to view and manage your settings.

> [!WARNING]
> If you later change the class name or namespace, the settings may no longer match existing data unless you specify the new name/namespace explicitly.
> [Learn more about handling class name or namespace changes](docs/configuration-guide.md#handling-changes-to-class-names-or-namespaces).

## 🔹 Resolving Settings in the Application

You can inject and access your settings using **dependency injection**.

### 🔹 Accessing as a Singleton

Inject the setting directly into your constructor:

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private readonly MyFirstSettings _MyFirstSettings;

    public MyService(MyFirstSettings MyFirstSettings)
    {
        _MyFirstSettings = MyFirstSettings;
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Using IOptions<T> for Configuration Binding

Alternatively, use `IOptions<T>` for accessing configuration-based settings:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;

public class MyService
{
    private readonly MyFirstSettings _MyFirstSettings;

    public MyService(IOptions<MyFirstSettings> options)
    {
        _MyFirstSettings = options.Value;
    }
}
```

This approach is useful when the settings are dynamically **loaded from configuration sources**.

> [!NOTE]
> The default settings registration mode is `Both`, meaning it supports both **Singleton** and **IOptions<T>** interfaces. You can change this behavior as needed.

### 🔹 Resolving Settings Without Dependency Injection  

If you need to access settings outside of DI, use `SettingsProvider.GetLocalSettingOrDefault<T>()`. This method returns the setting if found or falls back to the default value (which, in our case, is `null`).

```csharp
using OpenSettings;

var MyFirstSettings = SettingsProvider.GetLocalSettingOrDefault<MyFirstSettings>();
```
